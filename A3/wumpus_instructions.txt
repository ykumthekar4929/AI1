The Wumpus Rules

Here is what we know to be true in any wumpus world, for the purposes of this assignment
(NOTE THAT THESE RULES ARE NOT IDENTICAL TO THE ONES IN THE TEXTBOOK):

1. If there is a monster at square (i,j), there is stench at all adjacent squares.
2. If there is stench at square (i,j), there is a monster at one of the adjacent squares.
3. If there is a pit at square (i,j), there is breeze at all adjacent squares.
4. If there is breeze at square (i,j), there is a pit at one or more of the adjacent squares.
5. There is one and only one monster (no more, no fewer).
6. Squares (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) have no monsters and no pits.
7. The number of pits can be between 1 and 11.
8. We don't care about gold, glitter, and arrows, there will be no information about them in the knowledge base, and no reference to them in the statement.
